## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For Realtime Database
- Flexbox
- Desktop and Mobile layout - Responsive

### What I learned

This project was mostly a practice of my React knowledge. 
It helped me to dive more into the use of state through components, using Context, and stateless and statefull components.
I also have learned how to use prefer-color-scheme in CSS.
